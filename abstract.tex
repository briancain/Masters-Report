In this paper I present \projectName{}, a front end web framework that interfaces with \ancor{}. \projectName{} aims to provide \ancor{}â€™s users with an easy to use front end interface for accomplishing various use-cases against the \ancor{} framework. \projectName{} was developed mainly in AngularJS, a lightweight JavaScript framework. This dashboard is able to accomplish everything that the \ancor{} Command Line Interface, or \ancorcli, is able to do. This framework also needed to provide some information about the state of the system through various data gathered from \ancor{} in a human readable format. Not only should it be able to inform the user about the state of \ancor{} but it needs to be able to perform operations against \ancor{} just like the command line interface can do.

This report documents the design and implementation of \projectName. It will detail the necessary background of the project, and overview of the framework, and discussion of implementation and component breakdown. I will also provide an evaluation of the dashboard and a discussion about future work with \projectName{}.
