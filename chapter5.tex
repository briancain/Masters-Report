\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{makereference5}

In this report, I have presented \projectName{}, a front end web application dashboard that interacts with the \ancor{} project. Built with the latest web technologies, \projectName{} is a powerfully light tool that makes using \ancor{} easier. Designed with the intention of replicating all of the functionalities that the \ancorcli{} provides, combined with the visual advantages that a dashboard provides, \projectName{} helps \ancor{} users be more productive and gives them a new experience when looking at the state of their deployed IT system.

\section{Source Code}
\label{makereference5.1}

The complete source code is currently located on a public repository on Github. The URL can be found below:

\begin{list}{-}{}
\item \url{https://github.com/arguslab/ancor-dashboard}
\end{list}

The repository offers a quick start guide for those wishing to contribute or test out \projectName{}. It also provides the binary files required for users to deploy within an Apache or Nginx deployment. This is provided so users will not have to install all of the dependencies needed to run the project locally.
