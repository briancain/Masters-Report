% | References
% |
% | This template uses BibTeX, which is the bibliography formatting and
% | collating system for all versions of LaTeX.  In this file, here's what
% | you can do:
% |
% | - Use the @STRING command to define abbreviations.
% |
% | - Group citations by subject area.  This will make it easier to organize
% |   your references.
% |
% | - Include the bibliographic data for each reference (author, title, journal,
% |   date, etc).
% |
% | Much of the information presented here is taken from these sources:
% |
% |   The BibTeX Bibliography Database

% | About BibTeK
% |
% | In the template file (etdrtemplate.tex) we used the command \bibliography
% | to specify the name of the BibTeX database file (this file, references.bib).
% | It's in this file that the actual bibliographic data are stored (author,
% | title, journal, date, etc.)
% |
% | References to items in the bibliography are made with the \cite command.
% | Examples of this command are shown in the file chapter1.tex
% |
% | As LaTeX processes files, it creates an auxiliary file (etdrtemplate.aux)
% | that lists all references, i.e, any place where the \cite command was
% | used, and the bibliograhy style (specificed in the \bibliographystyle
% | command).  The BibTeX program reads this auxiliary file and creates
% | a .bbl file which contains the LaTeX source code for items in the
% | bibliography.
% |
% | To process a document with a bibliography, follow this sequence:
% | -Run LaTeX to write the .aux file
% | -Run BibTeK to create the .bbl file
% | -Run LaTeX twice to resolve references and include the bibliography
% |
% +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+


% +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
% |
% | The @STRING command is used to define abbreviations.  This is especially
% | useful in defining an abbreviation to represent journal titles (or
% | abbreviations).  In the first example below, "ARPC" is defined to represent
% | "Annu. Rev. Phy. Chem." (the standard abbreviation for the journal "Annual
% | Review of Physics and Chemistry.")  Any reference in your text to ARPC will
% | be replaced by the full string, Annu. Rev. Phy. Chem.  Abbreviations are not
% | case sensitive, i.e, "arpc" and "ARPC" are treated as the same
% |
% +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

@STRING(  ARPC = "Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem.")
@STRING(   JCP = "J.~Chem. Phys.")
@STRING( JOSAB = "J.~Opt. Soc. Am.~B")
@STRING(   PRL = "Phys. Rev. Lett.")
@STRING(   RMP = "Rev. Mod. Phys.")

% | Formatting Citations
% |
% | Here are examples of how to format data for items in your bibliography
% |
% | BibTeX database files (extension .bib) are plain text files. They consist of
% | entries of various kinds. Each entry describes a book, an article, a
% | manual, etc. Example:
% |
% |   @BOOK{GEN:Bransden:2003,
% |
% |        AUTHOR = "B.~H.~Bransden and C.~J.~Joachain",
% |         TITLE = "Physics of Atoms and Molecules",
% |     PUBLISHER = "New York: Prentice-Hall",
% |        VOLUME = "2nd Ed.",
% |          YEAR = 2003
% |
% | The "@BOOK" states that this is an entry of type book. Various entry types are
% | described below.
% |
% | The "GEN:Bransden:2003" is the key, as it appears in the argument of
% | a \cite command referring to the entry.  You can use the first element
% | in the key, e.g., "GEN" to group together items on the same general
% | topic (see examples below).
% |
% | This entry has four fields, named AUTHOR, TITLE, PUBLISHER, and ADDRESS.
% | The meanings of these and other fields are described below. A field consists
% | of the name, followed by an "=" character with optional space around it,
% | followed by its text. The text of a field is a string of characters, with
% | no unmatched braces, surrounded by either a pair of braces or a pair
% | of " characters. Entry fields are separated from one another, and from
% | the key, by commas. A comma may have optional space around it.
% |
% | BibTeX ignores the case of letters in the entry type, key, and field names.
% |
% | The quotes or braces can be omitted around text consisting entirely of
% | numerals: Volume = "27" is equivalent to Volume = 27.
% +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

% +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
% | Standard entry types
% |
% | Entries of different types have different fields. For each entry type,
% | the fields are divided into three classes:
% |     required
% |     optional
% |     ignored
% |
% | BibTeK ignores any fields that are not required or optional, so you
% | can add fields for any additional information you'd like to retain
% | about the reference, such as a file name, abstract, notes, etc.  The
% | information will not appear in the formatted bibliography, but it will
% | be retained in your references.bib file.
% |

% |
